                <p>As we move through 2025, several key trends are shaping the remote work landscape:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Global talent pools:</strong> Companies are hiring remotely across borders, creating international competition but also global opportunities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid models:</strong> While fully remote roles remain popular, many companies are adopting hybrid models with 1-2 office days per week.</li>
                    <li><strong>Results-only work environment (ROWE):</strong> More companies are focusing on output rather than hours worked, giving employees greater flexibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remote-first companies:</strong> Organizations are being built from the ground up as remote-first, with distributed teams as the default.</li>
                </ul>

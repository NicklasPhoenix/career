            <section id="intro">
                <p>Changing careers at 30 is one of the most common career transitions professionals make. Research shows the average person changes careers 5-7 times in their lifetime, with 30 being a peak age for career changes. If you're considering a career change at 30, you're in a great position to make a successful transition.</p>
                
                <p>At 30, you have valuable work experience that can be transferred to a new field, but you're still young enough to have a long career ahead in your new profession. The key is having a strategic plan and understanding the steps needed for a smooth transition.</p>

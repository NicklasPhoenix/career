                <p>Whether you're starting your career or transitioning from another field, here are steps to enter finance:</p>
                
                <h3>Educational Foundation</h3>
                <p>Obtain a bachelor's degree in finance, accounting, economics, or a related field.

                <h3>Obtain Necessary Licenses</h3>
                <p>Many finance roles require specific licenses. For example, financial advisors need Series 7 and 66 licenses, while investment bankers may need Series 79. Research the requirements for your target career and prepare for the exams.</p>
                
                <h3>Pursue Professional Certifications</h3>
                <p>Consider pursuing certifications like CFA, CPA, or CFP to enhance your credentials and marketability. These certifications demonstrate commitment to the profession and can accelerate career advancement.</p>
